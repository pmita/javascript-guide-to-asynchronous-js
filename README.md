##Ajax intro

```
/*What is AJAX? It stands for Asynchronous javascript and XML and is a way for javscript
to cope with complex scenarios. At it's core, javascript is a single thread language, meaning
it can only do one operaition at a time. This translates to 1 line of code at a time*/

/*However, some lines of code cannot be executed until further details or actions have been fulfilled first
For example, we can fetch data from our database but we cannot display them until we have all the data back from
our db. Instead of our code stalling, js simply moves to the next lines and comes back once everything is ready*/
